# RhinoAssemblyOutliner

**SolidWorks-style Assembly Outliner for Rhino 8**

A dockable panel plugin that brings hierarchical block instance management to Rhino 8 — inspired by the SolidWorks FeatureManager Design Tree. Navigate, control visibility, and organize complex block assemblies with ease.

## Features

### 🌳 Hierarchical Tree View
Recursive visualization of block instances with expand/collapse, showing the full nesting hierarchy of your assembly. Linked (🔗), embedded (📦), and linked+embedded (📎) blocks are distinguished by icon.

### 👁️ Visibility Control
Toggle visibility per instance with the eye icon column. Supports **Show/Hide with Dependents** for recursive operations on entire sub-trees. Parent nodes display a mixed-state icon (◐) when some children are hidden.

### 🔍 Isolate Mode
Isolate one or more instances to focus your work. A banner shows "Isolate Mode — N of M visible" with a quick exit button. All other objects are temporarily hidden.

### 🏗️ Assembly Mode
Set any block instance as the **Assembly Root** to focus the tree on a single sub-assembly. Switch between Document Mode and Assembly Mode via the toolbar dropdown.

### 🔗 Bidirectional Selection Sync
Click a node in the tree to select it in the viewport — or select in the viewport and the tree follows. Debounced for smooth interaction.

### 📋 Detail Panel
View selected item properties including definition name, instance number, layer, link type, and user attributes (UserText key-value pairs).

### 🔎 Search & Filter
Filter the tree by object or definition name with case-insensitive search.

### ↕️ Drag & Drop Reorder
Reorder items within the tree via drag and drop (within the outliner panel).

## Roadmap

### v1.0 — Current
- Full assembly tree with visibility control, isolate mode, keyboard shortcuts, assembly mode, search, detail panel, selection sync, drag-drop reorder, status bar, mixed-state eye icons, context menu with visibility/selection/navigation/editing sections.

### v2.0 — Per-Instance Component Visibility (in progress)
- **C++ DisplayConduit** intercepting `SC_DRAWOBJECT` for per-component draw control ✅ built
- Hide individual components within a single block instance (not all instances of that definition)
- `ON_UserData` persistence — hidden component state saved in `.3dm` files ✅ built
- P/Invoke bridge with 14 native API functions ✅ built
- Document event handling (auto-sync on open/save/close) ✅ built
- Path-based component addressing for nested blocks ✅ built
- Performance target: >30 fps with 100+ managed instances
